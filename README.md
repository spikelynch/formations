# Formations

_Formations_ is a parody of two parallel strands of twentieth-century
literature: the tendency in the French nouveau roman towards precise,
bloodless, geometrical descriptions of the everyday world, and that
style of science fiction writing which uses abstract language in an
attempt to convey alien or futuristic impossibilities. The apotheosis
of the latter, with possibly some influence from the former, are the
descriptions of the living planetary ocean in the original
Polish-to-French-to-English translation of Stanislaw Lem's _Solaris_.

I didn't do anything technically innovative for _Formations_, I
knocked it up fast using my half-baked Haskell library for text
generators, [TextGen](https://github.com/spikelynch/textgen). And the
grammar is pretty shaky, as I had to use some really dodgy kludges to
get verb inflection working. (This is why there's a function called
"binflect".) But it's given me some ideas on how to upgrade TextGen so
that it can do that better.

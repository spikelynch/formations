A blue cube appeared agains a field of white vapor. Its upper surface
was decorated with red lozenges. From its left side extended thirteen
tentacles with the texture of soft fruit.

The cube moved slowly. The tentacles grew longer and walked softly
toward the east.

The tentacles were covered in thousands of small white spheres each of
which was a millimetre in diameter. The spheres crepitated
vigourously.
